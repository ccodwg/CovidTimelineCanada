# Timeline of COVID-19 in Canada

The Timeline of COVID-19 in Canada (`CovidTimelineCanada`) is intended to be the definitive source for data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. In addition to making available the ready-to-use datasets, this repository also acts as a hub for collaboration on expanding and improving the availability and quality of COVID-19 data in Canada.

Datasets in this repository are found in the [`data`](https://github.com/ccodwg/CovidTimelineCanada/tree/main/data) directory and are updated automatically several times per day by [`Covid19CanadaBot`](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19CanadaBot). Map, population and other spatial data are provided in the [`geo`](https://github.com/ccodwg/CovidTimelineCanada/tree/main/geo) directory.

This repository is maintained by the [COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group](https://opencovid.ca/) and is one component of the **[What Happened? COVID-19 in Canada](https://whathappened.coronavirus.icu/)** project. The data in this repository will eventually conform to the [Data and Metadata Standard for COVID-19 Data in Canada](https://github.com/ccodwg/CovidDataStandard), which is undergoing collaborative development.

Note that on April 30, 2022, `CovidTimelineCanada` superseded the original **[`Covid19Canada`](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada)** dataset, which was first made available in March of 2020. For those familiar with the original dataset, please see the notes below about working with the new dataset.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Province/territory (PT) names are now given using two-letter codes and health region (HR) names are given using unique identifiers**. See the [geo](https://github.com/ccodwg/CovidTimelineCanada/tree/main/geo) directory for files that can be used to map these values to alternative names. The [JSON API](https://api.opencovid.ca/) is also capable of performing these conversions automatically through the use of the `pt_names` and `hr_names` parameters.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Each time series now ends on the date the data were last updated** (e.g., if case data in a province was updated on January 6 with data up to January 3, the case time series for that province would end on January 3). Previously, every time series ended on the most recent date. Time series data with rows up to the most recent date for every time series are available from the `timeseries` route of the [API](https://api.opencovid.ca/) using the `fill=true` parameter. This also means that PT time series data cannot be simply aggregated up into a Canadian time series without additional processing‚Äîready-to-use Canadian data are provided in `data/can` or through the API. **Note that the Canadian time series should be considered incomplete since many provinces/territories have not provided data for the most recent dates.**

  ‚ùó For convenience, **case and death datasets using the old column names, date format, province/territory names and health region names are being offered for download as CSV files**. These files should be more-or-less drop-in replacements for the old case and death datasets. However, we encourage users to switch to the new dataset format, as this legacy format will not be supported indefinitely. Download links for the CSV files:

  - [Cases (health regions)](https://api.opencovid.ca/timeseries?stat=cases&geo=hr&legacy=true&fmt=csv)
  - [Cases (provinces/territories)](https://api.opencovid.ca/timeseries?stat=cases&geo=pt&legacy=true&fmt=csv)
  - [Deaths (health regions)](https://api.opencovid.ca/timeseries?stat=deaths&geo=hr&legacy=true&fmt=csv)
  - [Deaths (provinces/territories)](https://api.opencovid.ca/timeseries?stat=deaths&geo=pt&legacy=true&fmt=csv)

## How to download these data

To download all the datasets in this repository, click the big green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP". Save it to the location of your choice and unzip the contents. All of the CSV files containing the data can be opened using your spreadsheet software or statistical package of choice.

Individual CSV files in the `data` directory may be downloaded by right clicking the "Raw" button on the page and selecting "Save link as...".

More complex queries are available via our API: [https://api.opencovid.ca/](https://api.opencovid.ca/), which can return data in JSON or CSV format. This is the preferred option for advanced data users.

## Data format

- `name`: The name of the metric (e.g., cases, testing)
- `province`: The two-letter code for the province or territory (e.g., ON, AB)
- `sub_region_1`: The unique identifier of the health region (e.g., 3595, 594) (this column is absent for PT-level data)
- `sub_region_2`: The name of the sub-region (e.g., Downtown, Yellowknife) (this column is absent for PT and HR-level data)
- `date`: The date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `value`: The cumulative value (e.g., cumulative number of cases, number of active hospitalizations)
- `value_daily`: The daily value (e.g., daily number of cases, change in the number of active hospitalizations)

## Contributing

To contribute to this project, please refer to the ongoing discussions in the issues board or open up a new one. We need help identifying the best data sources for each value and harmonizing them into a single dataset. Please add new data sources to the [wiki page](https://github.com/ccodwg/CovidTimelineCanada/wiki/List-of-data-sources).

We must also identify gaps in publicly available data. These data may then be requested from the relevant agencies or acquired via Access to Information requests (see [an example with Sasksatchewan's COVID-19 data](https://data.gripe/covid-19-in-saskatchewan/)).

Both the cumulative values (`value`) and the daily differences (`value_daily`) are given for each date where data are available.

## How these data are kept up to date

The data in this repository are updated several times per day by [`Covid19CanadaBot`](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19CanadaBot) using the script [`update_data.R`](https://github.com/ccodwg/CovidTimelineCanada/blob/main/update_data.R). At present, this process relies on the following R packages:

* [`Covid19CanadaData`](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19CanadaData): Loads the live version of a specified public dataset (denoted by its UUID in [`dataset.json`](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19CanadaArchive/blob/master/datasets.json)) using the function `Covid19CanadaData::dl_dataset`
* [`Covid19CanadaDataProcess`](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19CanadaDataProcess): Processes a given dataset into a standardized data format
* [`Covid19CanadaDataETL`](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19CanadaETL): The ETL (extract-transform-load) package coordinates downloading, processing and writing the final combined datasets
