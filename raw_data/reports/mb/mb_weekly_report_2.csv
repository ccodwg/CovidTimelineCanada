Province-level totals agree with the numbers reported to PHAC for weeks 27-28 (combined) and week 29. Assigned "cumulative_hospitalizations_diff" and "cumulative_icu_diff" the values of "cumulative_hospitalizations_since_2023-07-02" and "cumulative_icu_since_2023-07-02", respectively. This is because the final report using the previous columns, "cumulative_hospitalizations_since_2022-07-03" and "cumulative_icu_since_2023-07-02", included data up to 2023-07-01. Assigned "tests_completed" the value of "cumulative_tests_completed_2023-07-02" for the same reason.
