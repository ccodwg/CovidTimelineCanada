Deaths: settled on 1, the monthly number of deaths reported, since none of the deaths reported in the weekly reports from April were from the current reporting period, all were from the previous reporting period. Considered 383 (cumulative sum since 2022-07-01 in May report) - 374 (cumulative sum since 2022-07-01 in April report) - 13 (newly reported deaths between the 2023-05-08 and 2023-05-22 reports), but this results in a negative number. 383 (cumulative sum since 2022-07-01 in May report) - 424 (daily sum since 2022-07-01 from time series) also results in a negative number, presumably due to internal backdating of deaths. Date report was released in unknown, so used first date report was downloaded for date column.

Neither do monthly reported cases and deaths line up with the difference from the cumulative total since July 2022. However, at least this month, the hospitalization metric lines up on both counts. Due to the discrepencies between monthly and cumulative numbers, as well as the fact that the previous month (May 2023) was only partially reported using the epidemiology reports and some guesswork was done to assign the values, the trend in deaths mentioned in the report/table (that they declined between May 2023 to June 2023) are not reflected in the numbes we calculate and report for this month.
